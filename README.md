- Hi, I’m @touseefahmed6

👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies and learning about innovative solutions that can solve real-world problems. I'm also interested in web development.

🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis with Python and machine learning algorithms. I'm also improving my skills in front-end development with React and back-end development with Node.js and Express.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development. I believe in the power of collaboration and would love to work with other developers who share the same passion and vision as I do.

📫 You can reach me through my email halepoto69@gmail.com or connect with me on my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/touseef-ahmed-4394ba260. Don't hesitate to send me a message if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions about my projects and experiences.
